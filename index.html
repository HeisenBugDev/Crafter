<a name="what-it-is" class="anchor" href="#what-it-is"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it is</h3>

<p>Crafter is a package manager. What is a package manager, you may ask? A package manager is a program that, well, manages packagesâ€”that is to say, it automates installing things. So, on Debian-based systems, instead of downloading and running the installer for GParted, you could run sudo apt-get install gparted in a terminal and your package manager will automagically download and install everything needed for GParted.</p>

<p>How does this apply to Minecraft? Well, imagine that instead of digging through forums and wading through Adf.ly links, all you had to do to install a mod was crafter install. Would that be awesome? Of course! That is exactly what Crafter does.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it Works</h3>

<p>Crafter hooks into a massive mod repository called HeisenBugDev. Modders host their mods on HeisenBugDev so that they can be distributed more easily. Plus, the modders get a cut of the ad revenue.</p>

<p>Then, various launchers like Crafter hook into HeisenBugDev to get the mods needed. Crafter is different from all the others because it has a CLI and a GUI, which means that anyone can use the GUI to install mods, but superusers can use the more powerful CLI.</p>

<h3>
<a name="modpacks" class="anchor" href="#modpacks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modpacks</h3>

<p>By now, you're probably wondering: What about modpacks? We've come up with a fantstic system for that: Craftfiles. All you have to do to install a modpack is crafter install . Crafter will download the Craftfile, parse it, and download and configure all the required mods. Craftfile markup is the simplest possible: it's just Ruby!</p>

<p>Remember that GUI we mentioned earlier? You can generate Craftfiles with it, too. Here's the markup:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="n">minecraft</span> <span class="s1">'1.6.4'</span>
<span class="n">forge</span>     <span class="s1">'1234'</span>
          <span class="c1"># Other options are "latest" or "recommended" (default)</span>

<span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'heisenbugdev'</span> <span class="c1"># some sugar for http(s)://heisenbugdev.com</span>
<span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'github://ZephireNZ@Quickmods/index.json'</span> <span class="c1"># A quickmod index (syntax is for MultiMC compat)</span>
<span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://github.com/luacs1998/QuickModFiles'</span> <span class="c1"># This will automatically detect the index.json</span>

<span class="n">mod</span> <span class="s1">'QuantumCraft'</span> <span class="c1"># gets latest QuantumCraft from heisenbugdev</span>
<span class="n">mod</span> <span class="s1">'SpongesMod'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'@1.6.4'</span>
                  <span class="c1"># Any version for 1.6.4 (1.6 will match to 1.6.x)</span>
                  <span class="c1"># Also valid would be '&gt;=2.0.2' and other normal matchers</span>
                  <span class="c1"># Defaults to current MC version (Ignore the last digit?)</span>

<span class="n">mod</span> <span class="s1">'ProjectRed'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">github</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'MrTJP/ProjectRed'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">ref</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'v1.0'</span>
                                              <span class="c1"># Ref can either be a git tag,</span>
                                              <span class="c1"># commit, or branch</span>
