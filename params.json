{"name":"Crafter","tagline":"Minecraft Package Manager","body":"### What it is\r\n\r\nCrafter is a package manager. What is a package manager, you may ask? A package manager is a program that, well, manages packagesâ€”that is to say, it automates installing things. So, on Debian-based systems, instead of downloading and running the installer for GParted, you could run sudo apt-get install gparted in a terminal and your package manager will automagically download and install everything needed for GParted.\r\n\r\nHow does this apply to Minecraft? Well, imagine that instead of digging through forums and wading through Adf.ly links, all you had to do to install a mod was crafter install. Would that be awesome? Of course! That is exactly what Crafter does.\r\n\r\n### How it Works\r\n\r\nCrafter hooks into a massive mod repository called HeisenBugDev. Modders host their mods on HeisenBugDev so that they can be distributed more easily. Plus, the modders get a cut of the ad revenue.\r\n\r\nThen, various launchers like Crafter hook into HeisenBugDev to get the mods needed. Crafter is different from all the others because it has a CLI and a GUI, which means that anyone can use the GUI to install mods, but superusers can use the more powerful CLI.\r\n\r\n### Modpacks\r\n\r\nBy now, you're probably wondering: What about modpacks? We've come up with a fantstic system for that: Craftfiles. All you have to do to install a modpack is crafter install <modpack name>. Crafter will download the Craftfile, parse it, and download and configure all the required mods. Craftfile markup is the simplest possible: it's just Ruby!\r\n\r\nRemember that GUI we mentioned earlier? You can generate Craftfiles with it, too. Here's the markup:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nminecraft '1.6.4'\r\nforge     '1234'\r\n          # Other options are \"latest\" or \"recommended\" (default)\r\n\r\nsource 'heisenbugdev' # some sugar for http(s)://heisenbugdev.com\r\nsource 'github://ZephireNZ@Quickmods/index.json' # A quickmod index (syntax is for MultiMC compat)\r\nsource 'https://github.com/luacs1998/QuickModFiles' # This will automatically detect the index.json\r\n\r\nmod 'QuantumCraft' # gets latest QuantumCraft from heisenbugdev\r\nmod 'SpongesMod', '@1.6.4'\r\n                  # Any version for 1.6.4 (1.6 will match to 1.6.x)\r\n                  # Also valid would be '>=2.0.2' and other normal matchers\r\n                  # Defaults to current MC version (Ignore the last digit?)\r\n\r\nmod 'ProjectRed', github: 'MrTJP/ProjectRed', ref: 'v1.0'\r\n                                              # Ref can either be a git tag,\r\n                                              # commit, or branch\r\n\r\n# Aliased to rp\r\nresourcepack '', url: 'http://dropbox/.../bleh.zip'\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
